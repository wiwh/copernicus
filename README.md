## Accessing data
Every project is associated with a folder with a unique name, and its data is stored in `.data/<project_name>`.
## Downloading existing data
The data folder is compulsory for running the scripts, but are not available form Github due to their sizes. Please download them using [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1b3cmbvDYW0IraTEe_78Ws4OEvsFnsT?usp=sharing). There is no guarantee that the link will always work. If it doesn't, you will be required to download your own data.
