Analysis of satellite data using Copernicus Sentinels satellites imagery.

## Accessing data
Every project is associated with a folder with a unique name, and its data is stored in `.data/<project_name>`.
## Downloading existing data
The `./data/` folder is compulsory for running the scripts, but its content is not available form Github due to the size of the images. You need to manually create the folder and download its content using [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1b3cmbvDYW0IraTEe_78Ws4OEvsFnsT?usp=sharing). There is no guarantee that the link will always work. If it doesn't, you will be required to download your own data.
